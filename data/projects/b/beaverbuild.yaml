description:
  Beaverbuild is a block‑building infrastructure provider for Ethereum
  that offers RPC endpoints to submit private transactions or bundles for inclusion
  in blocks. Builders construct a payload for a block and send it to an MEV relay
  along with an ETH bid; the relay forwards this to the next proposer if they use
  services like MEV‑boost. If the validator accepts, they include the provided payload
  instead of building their own block.
