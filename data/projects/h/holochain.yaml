description:
  Holochain is an open‑source framework for building peer‑to‑peer applications
  that runs on an “agent‑centric” model rather than traditional consensus blockchains.
  It provides tools and libraries for developers to create distributed apps (hApps)
  where each user stores their own chain and data is shared via a distributed hash
  table. The platform emphasises scalability, data ownership, and resilience without
  relying on global consensus mechanisms.
